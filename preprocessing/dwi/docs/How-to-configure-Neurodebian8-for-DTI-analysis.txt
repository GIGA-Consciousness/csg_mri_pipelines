How to configure Neurodebian 8 for DTI analysis (in a Virtual Machine such as VirtualBox)
Written on 2018-11-12 by Stephen Karl Larroque

Enable Virtualization Technology in your BIOS (and optionally VT-x)
Launch the virtual machine (or create it after downloading the appliance on Neurodebian website)
sudo apt-get remove python-cryptography
sudo apt-get remove python
install anaconda2 (Python 2) - do NOT use the standard python bundled with Debian!
python fsl.py
then add variables of FSL in .bashrc
sudo apt-get install ants
sudo find / -name "N4BiasFieldCorrection"
export PATH="/usr/lib/ants:$PATH"
pip install nipype
pip install dipy
install MRTRIX3 as per the documentation (from the github) (make sure your VM is configured with at least 4096 GB, it's necessary to complete the ./build command of MRTRIX3, else it will run indefinitely).
Then you can run the scripts!
In Trackvis, open Allbrain.trk and use Threshold 95% and uncheck y slice filter. Then put Trackvis in fullscreen, zoom in as much as possible while stil seeing the full brain (use ALT + left click to move the brain around) and then save pictures on different angles (front, left, right, top, back). Use CTRL + Left click to rotate, and CTRL+R to reset the view (but might not be correctly oriented).
Optional: sudo apt-get install gimp, to adjust generated images
