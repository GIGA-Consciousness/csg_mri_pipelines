This python script is just an utility to stitch together multiple images of different orientation of the DWI tracts, for a nice presentation to patients families.

This is not necessary but is an example of further automatization.

To use it, it expects 5 images in the same folder as the script and named "top.png", "front.png", "back.png", "left.png" and "right.png".
