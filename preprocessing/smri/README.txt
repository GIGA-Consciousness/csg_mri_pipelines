Structural MRI voxel-based morphometry with DARTEL analysis pipeline using VBM8 and SPM8 or CAT12 and SPM12. The entry script is vbm_script_preproc_csg.m (requires MATLAB) and also needs Python with PILLOW if you want to automatically generate result images. This pipeline is also interesting to see how it is possible to fully automate graphical results generation in SPM.
